"title": "They Live",
"review": "A must-see! As a custruction worker, I think it's well known how hard the labor can be and the toll on your
body is sometimes not worth the risk. What isn't talked about is PPE on the jobsite and how often coworkers turn a blind
eye to someone not wearing protective eyewear. The length that Mr. Piper goes through to ensure his fellow peer is
following OSHA standards is commendable and this film had the guts to take a stand on unsafe work standards!",
